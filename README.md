#Introduction to MATLAB
MATLAB (Matrix Laboratory) is a high-performance programming language and environment designed for numerical computation, visualization, and programming. It integrates computation, visualization, and programming in an easy-to-use environment where problems and solutions are expressed in familiar mathematical notation.

**Objectives and Uses**
MATLAB is widely used for:

1. Numerical Computation: Perform complex mathematical calculations, solve equations, and perform matrix operations.
2. Data Analysis and Visualization: Analyze data, create plots and graphs, and visualize complex data sets.
3. Algorithm Development: Develop and test algorithms for various applications, including engineering and scientific problems.
4. Modeling and Simulation: Create models to simulate real-world systems and processes, and analyze their behavior.
5. Application Development: Develop custom applications with graphical user interfaces.
